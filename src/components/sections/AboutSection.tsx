        <p>
          I'm a data scientist and an engineer who enjoy building end to end AI systems.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Throughout my career, I have worked on diverse projects across industries such 
          as finance, climate, tech, smart building, and marketing. Each one taught me 
          something new about working with complex data and solving real-world 
          problems. My strength lies in using data to improve decision-making and make 
          things run more smoothly.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I've worked across the full stack â€” from training machine learning models and 
          writing clean Python code to designing simple, user-friendly interfaces and 
          shipping full products. I care just as much about how things work as how they 
          feel.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I'm also a cofounder and community organizer at Confio, a tech community I 
          helped start to bring curious minds together. We host events, share cool ideas, and try 
          to make learning in tech feel a little less lonely.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          When I'm not working, I'm usually sketching product ideas, experimenting with 
          new tools, or designing something visual just for fun.
